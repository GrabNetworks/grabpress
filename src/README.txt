== Description ==

GrabPress from Grab Media is the solution for publishers on the Wordpress platform using video to drive engagement and revenue on their sites. It allows website editors to publish high quality video content within their Wordpress sites. The integration of the Grab Media video catalog with your content management system via the GrabPress plug-in enables all assets of the content catalog-including the video titles, descriptions, keywords, and preview images to be published along with the video content, or to be leveraged in content promotional themes and widgets.

By automating video delivery GrabPress cuts the legwork needed to ensure a sound video strategy on your site. Whether you run your own site, or work with a team of editors, it can be tricky to get on the same page regarding video. GrabPress is built to ease those pains, and provide a dependable work-flow editors can leverage into larger revenue streams.

Beyond delivery of premium content, work-flow optimization, and revenue through GrabPress, publishers also get insight into activity reporting by tying their Grab Media account to the GrabPress plug in. With GrabPress, the editor is in control to create more content and increase the value of their page views.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Getting Started...**

= How do I set up an account with Grab Media? =

 After installing the plug-in, click on GrabPress and then click on the Account link.  This will bring up the option to create a new account with Grab Media, or to link an existing account with us. 

= I already have an account with Grab Media—how do I tie my existing account to Grab Press? =

 Same as above--after installing the plug-in, click on GrabPress and then click on the Account link.  This will bring up the option to create a new account with Grab Media, or to link an existing account with us.

= How do I check my statistics?  =

 Go to Grab-Media.com and click Sign-in.  Use the email and password credentials you created at account sign up to log in to the Publisher Report Portal. 

= I would like to get more data than the report portal provides.  How can I get that?

Grab can provide you automated, daily data exports that enable you to perform your own performance analyses.  Contact us and we can provide you the data that you need. 


**Creating Auto Posting Feeds**

= I have installed the plug-in and set up my account.  Now what? =

 Once GrabPress is installed you should be prompted to set up your first feed, by supplying the proper search criteria and setting options regarding your post interval. Once you have set up a feed, you should click the account tab to create a new account or link your user account with your installation.  When these steps are completed you may add additional feeds or manage the feeds you have created at any time.

= Why don't I see any videos in the preview? =

 If you have set up a feed and hit preview, however no videos are populating the preview area it means we do not have any videos listed in the criteria you have specified in your search.  We recommend changing your search inputs and broadening your criteria until the preview displays enough assets to upkeep your selected post intervals.

= What is the most videos I can set to receive?  =

 GrabPress currently supports up to 5 posts every 12 hours. These posts will enter your draft folder or be published at the same time each 12 hour interval.  If you want constant autoposts, create feeds throughout the day, and leverage multiple feeds to create shorter intervals as needed.

= Why did I stop receiving video posts? =

 If your feed was delivering posts upon creation, but is no longer sending posts, most likely it means your search criteria does not update enough to upkeep your post interval.  First, edit your feed and hit the preview button. If the feed appears to be populating regularly, contact your representative. If you notice the feed has not gotten a new video in an extended period of time, broaden your search criteria and resubmit the feed.

= Can I edit or delete feeds I have created? =

 Once a feed is created it is displayed in a field below the feed creator. To delete a feed, click the black "x" next to the feed criteria. To edit, click edit next to the feed criteria. It will repopulate the corresponding fields in the feed creator where you can adjust and save your feed.

= Why do I need an account with Grab Media? =
 
 Creating or linking an account is how we keep track of your players and make sure you get paid. We use this information in the video embeds associated with your posts. This embed is then linked to your account and each impression it creates generates revenue for your site.

= How many feeds can I create? =
 There is no limit on the number of feeds you can create.

**General Questions**

= Why is there a tabbed index for GrabPress in my site dashboard? =
 GrabPress is built to scale. That means we have many more features and ways of delivering monetized video intended for the future. This includes, but is not limited to, single video embed insertion via your post editor, post promotion, and layout editing. As features such as these become available through GrabPress updates, they will appear as additional tabs within GrabPress.

= How do I uninstall GrabPress? =
 Go to the plugins section of your site. Select uninstall under the GrabPress plugin. Uninstalling will delete your API key as well as all data associated with your account. All feeds, feed settings, and account info will be deleted and needs to be recreated or linked if GrabPress is installed again.

= Can I adjust the format posts are sent in? =
 Currently there is no way for the user to adjust the layout via the GrabPress plug-in. However, if you have a specific arrangement you wish the posts to be delivered in, please contact your representative and adjustments can be made on the back end for previously created feeds.
We hope to allow users to edit the layout / posting template in future updates of the plugin.

= What does the Post Author setting in GrabPress control? =

 Post Author refers to the displayed name associated with the generated posts. This field is populated with all author names currently in your blog, as well as the user "GrabPress" generated by the plugin upon installation.  We recommend selecting post authors to help you organize and make posts appear as organic as possible.

= What is the difference between auto-play and click-to-play? =

 Selecting auto-play means videos will automatically start playing when a user opens the page the video is on.  Selecting click-to-play means a user will have to click the video to start it. This can be ideal for manually edited posts, when you want users to engage with the video at some point after engaging with the article content.

= I have set my autoposts to appear as drafts, how do I publish them? =

 New posts will be delivered to your drafts folder or in your article post editor marked as (draft).

= What is the benefit of a video post?  =

 Page views where video is the focal point of the article makes your article page views more valuable. Not only are you creating pre-roll inventory where it was not available before, but you are doing it in the body of your article, creating engagement with the video content.

= Why should I use GrabPress to deliver video to my blog? =
 
 GrabPress automates delivery of topical content to your site. This cuts down the footwork needed to optimize revenue potential for individual posts on your site, as well as keeping your site up to date with hot topics being talked about now.  Not only does GrabPress deliver monetized multimedia posts based on your criteria, but it is built to be leveraged by teams large and small as a tool for editors to stay in touch with news, gossip, and highlights that are happening now.

**Permissions** 

= Do all users see the same information in my GrabPress installation? =

 No. GrabPress leverages the user roles already in place within WordPress. In order to make sure you have all necessary functions available to you through GrabPress please set your user roles in your dashboard as needed. 

= What does each user role enable me to do through GrabPress? =

 All user roles are able to search our catalog for a video and create a post including that video and associated metadata, as well as insert single video embeds into previously created posts. 
 Additionally, editors have the ability to create content feeds from the Autoposter tab, edit feeds, and adjust templating options for the size of the embed. Editors have access to all functions and tabs, excluding the Account tab and account settings.
 Finally, as an admin all functions and tabs, including the Account tab, are available at all times. Once GrabPress is installed, the admin should link the install to their Grab Media account through the account tab, as no other user is able to link accounts.

= Can I set authors to be able to edit feeds or edit my account information? =

 To adjust what a user is able to do in GrabPress you must change their WordPress user role to enable the required functions. 

= As an editor, am I safe to link on a website with multiple editors? =
 Yes. Leveraging user role permissions will keep your install brand safe, allowing you to link your account and manage feeds without concern that these settings will be changed by someone with a less powerful user role, such as author, accidentally. 

= Can all users still view and post articles delivered through GrabPress? =
 Yes. All users can view the GrabPress dashboard to stay aware of editorial changes, and edit any post they have access to through the WordPress dashboard. 

= Can authors see my account information? =
 No. All users are provided pertinent information for debugging and support purposes, such as user email and API key. However, these users are not given access to personal information located in your account.
