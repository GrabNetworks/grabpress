**Creating Auto Posting Feeds...**

= I have installed the plug-in and set up my account.  Now what? =

 Once Grabpress is installed you should be prompted to set up your first feed, by supplying the proper search criteria and setting options regarding your post interval. Once you have set up a feed, you should click the account tab to create a new account or link your user account with your installation.  When these steps are completed you may add additional feeds or manage the feeds you have created at any time.

= Why don't I see any videos in the preview? =

 If you have set up a feed and hit preview, however no videos are populating the preview area it means we do not have any videos listed in the criteria you have specified in your search.  We recommend changing your search inputs and broadening your criteria until the preview displays enough assets to upkeep your selected post intervals.

= What is the most videos I can set to receive?  =

 Grabpress currently supports up to 5 posts every 12 hours. These posts will enter your draft folder or be published at the same time each 12 hour interval.  If you want constant autoposts, create feeds throughout the day, and leverage multiple feeds to create shorter intervals as needed.

= Why did I stop receiving video posts? =

 If your feed was delivering posts upon creation, but is no longer sending posts, most likely it means your search criteria does not update enough to upkeep your post interval.  First, edit your feed and hit the preview button. If the feed appears to be populating regularly, contact your representative. If you notice the feed has not gotten a new video in an extended period of time, broaden your search criteria and resubmit the feed.

= Can I edit or delete feeds I have created? =

 Once a feed is created it is displayed in a field below the feed creator. To delete a feed, click the black "x" next to the feed criteria. To edit, click edit next to the feed criteria. It will repopulate the corresponding fields in the feed creator where you can adjust and save your feed.

= Why do I need an account with Grab Media? =
 
 Creating or linking an account is how we keep track of your players and make sure you get paid. We use this information in the video embeds associated with your posts. This embed is then linked to your account and each impression it creates generates revenue for your site.

= How many feeds can I create? =
 There is no limit on the number of feeds you can create.

**General Questions...**

 Grabpress is built to scale. That means we have many more features and ways of delivering monetized video intended for the future. This includes, but is not limited to, single video embed insertion via your post editor, post promotion, and layout editing. As features such as these become available through Grabpress updates, they will appear as additional tabs within Grabpress.

 Currently there is no way for the user to adjust the layout via the Grabpress plug-in. However, if you have a specific arrangement you wish the posts to be delivered in, please contact your representative and adjustments can be made on the back end for previously created feeds.
We hope to allow users to edit the layout / posting template in future updates of the plugin.

= What does the Post Author setting in Grabpress control? =

 Post Author refers to the displayed name associated with the generated posts.

We recommend selecting post authors to help you organize and make posts appear as organic as possible.

= What is the difference between autoplay and click-to-play? =

 Selecting autoplay means videos will automatically start playing when a user opens the page the video is on.  Selecting click-to-play means a user will have to click the video to start it. This can be ideal for manually edited posts, when you want users to engage with the video at some point after engaging with the article content.

 New posts will be delivered to your drafts folder or in your article post editor marked as (draft).

 Page views where video is the focal point of the article makes your article page views more valuable. Not only are you creating pre-roll inventory where it was not available before, but you are doing it in the body of your article, creating engagement with the video content.
